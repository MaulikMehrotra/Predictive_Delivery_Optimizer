# Predictive Delivery Optimizer

### Overview
This project is a Predictive Delivery Optimizer designed to forecast potential delivery delays and provide key insights for logistics optimization.  
It integrates multiple logistics datasets â€” orders, delivery performance, routes, and fleet information â€” into a single analytical and predictive system.

The project uses Python, Streamlit, and Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier) to:
- Predict whether an order will be delayed.
- Analyze key performance indicators.
- Visualize delivery patterns.
- Provide interactive dashboards and insights for better decision-making.

---

### Features
- Data Cleaning & Integration: Combines multiple datasets (`orders.csv`, `delivery_performance.csv`, `routes_distance.csv`, `vehicle_fleet.csv`).
- Feature Engineering: Creates derived metrics like `Delay_Days`, `Fuel_Cost_per_KM`, `Delivery_Efficiency`, `Revenue_per_KM`, and `Satisfaction_Index`.
- Predictive Modeling: Trains a Random Forest classifier to predict delivery delays.
- Interactive Dashboard: Built using Streamlit for real-time analytics and visualization.
- Visualization Suite:
  - Delivery Delay by Priority (Box Plot)
  - Distance vs Delay (Scatter Plot)
  - Customer Satisfaction Distribution (Histogram)
  - Feature Importances (Bar Chart)
- Export Capability: Filtered datasets can be downloaded as CSV files.

### Model Summary
| Metric | Score |
|---------|-------|
| Model | Random Forest Classifier |
| Accuracy | ~85â€“90% |
| Target Variable | Delayed |
| Key Predictors | Distance, Priority, Traffic Delay, Order Value, Delivery Cost |

---

### Key Insights
- High Priority orders generally have lower delay probability.
- Longer routes correlate with higher delay risk.
- Customer Satisfaction Index is inversely proportional to delay duration.
- Delivery cost inefficiency increases with congestion.
